PROJECT TITLE: AI-Powered Code Reviewer and Quality Assistant

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
The AI-Powered Code Reviewer is a specialized static analysis tool designed to
automatically examine Python source code for quality, performance, and logic.
By combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing with Large Language Models (LLMs),
the system identifies structural "code smells," calculates complexity metrics,
and provides actionable feedback through a modern web dashboard and CLI.

This project bridges the gap between deterministic linting and human reasoning,
acting as a "Senior Developer" assistant that enforces standardized practices
while suggesting logic optimizations via the Gemini API.

SYSTEM WORKFLOW (THE PIPELINE)

STEP 1: INGESTION
User uploads .py files or pastes raw source code into the dashboard.
STEP 2: STATIC ANALYSIS (AST)
The backend walks the syntax tree to map structure (functions/classes)
and detect basic smells (magic numbers, unused variables).
STEP 3: METRICS ENGINE (RADON)
Calculates Cyclomatic Complexity (logical branching) and the
Maintainability Index (overall health score).
STEP 4: AI ENRICHMENT (GEMINI)
The Agentic engine refactors code, explains complex logic, and
generates unit tests using generative AI.
STEP 5: REPORTING & ACTION
Results are categorized by severity (Info, Warning, Critical). User
reviews suggestions in the UI or exports a CSV/HTML report.

MODULE BREAKDOWN (MODULES 1–6)
MODULE 1: CODE PARSING & ANALYSIS
Uses 'ast' to extract structural components.
Detects nesting depth and long functions.

MODULE 2: AI REVIEW ENGINE (AGENTIC FEATURES)
Refactor: Suggests Pythonic and efficient code versions.
Explain: Provides a step-by-step logic breakdown.
Test Generation: Automatically builds a PyTest suite for the code.

MODULE 3: VALIDATION & METRICS
Tracks Complexity (Radon CC) and Maintainability Index (MI).
Assigns Quality Grades: Excellent (90+), Good (75+), Average (60+), Poor.

MODULE 4: CLI & CONFIGURATION
Commands: scan, review, apply, report, diff, hook.
Configuration managed via 'pyproject.toml'.

MODULE 5: VCS & CI INTEGRATION
Standalone pre-commit hook script to block commits on CRITICAL issues.
CI/CD templates for automated quality gates.

MODULE 6: REVIEW WEB UI
Streamlit-powered dark-mode dashboard.
Side-by-side diff views and interactive metric gauges.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
BACKEND: Python 3.x, AST, Radon, Difflib, TOML.
FRONTEND: Streamlit, Lucide-Icons, Pandas.
AI MODEL: gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025.
PERSISTENCE: In-memory session state (Session-based analysis).

CONCLUSION
The project demonstrates that hybrid agentic workflows—combining static rules
with LLM reasoning—standardize code quality while significantly reducing
the human workload in the development lifecycle.
